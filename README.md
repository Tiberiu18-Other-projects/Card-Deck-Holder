### Commentary:
This project provided me with a deeper understanding of how templates function in higher-level languages. It also shed light on the way C processes data. Specifically, in C, data is processed based on the programmer's intent. At the memory level, there is no differentiation between integers, floats, or strings. All data is represented uniformly. What makes them distinct is how the compiler interprets and treats them.
